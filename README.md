# Portfolio 3.0
By Karen He, 2025.

I haven't updated the 2.0 in a really long time and I don't 
like how it looks anymore, so this is the attempt at 
jumping out of my high school self and into the me who has 
learned about design system and accessibility.

Skills practiced:
- Accessibility
  - Color contrast
  - Semantic HTML Tags
  - Use of heading tags
- Design System
  - Defined font sizes
  - Defined primary, secondary, and default font colors
  - Defined styles for each heading
- Responsive design [soon]

## TODO
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile
- [ ] only show menu icon on mobile
- [ ] Support for keyboard navigation

## Changes from 2.0
- Redesigned Theme
  - Cleaner color system consisting of red, white, and black (which matches my resume)
  - Fonts: Nunito, Roboto
- Uses semantic HTML tags for accessibility!
- Uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of npm for package management
